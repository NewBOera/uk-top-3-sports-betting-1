              <h2 class="  text-left font-bold ">Most Popular Sports Betting Types</h2>
              <p class="font-normal">
                The most popular betting markets in the United Kingdom are those that involve football and horse racing. Since UK bettors are most likely to bet on these markets they are also a focus
                for us when examining and evaluating the betting sites we recommend. With football betting the main focus is the variety of bets available and the quality of the in-play betting
                product while with the horses we focus on special event promotions such as during the Cheltenham and Grand National festivals. Accumulators are an important factor for both.
